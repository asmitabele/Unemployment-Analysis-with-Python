step4 : Check missing values<br>
print(df.isnull().sum())<br>

Converts the 'Date' column to proper datetime format for time-series analysis.<br>

Step 6: Unemployment Rate Over Time (Nationwide)<br>
Shows how the unemployment rate changed over months and years.<br>
Look for spikes during 2020-2021 (COVID period).
